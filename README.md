BinTree - A binary tree made from a list of strings. The code reads a data file consisting of many lines to build binary search trees. Each line consists of many strings and terminates with the string “$$”. Each line will be used to build one tree. The duplicated strings (i.e., having equal values with existing node data) are discarded, smaller strings go left, and bigger go right. 

Dijkstra's Graph - Implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The code reads a data file consisting of many lines and finds the lowest cost paths (findShortestPath function) and displays the cost and path from every node to every other node (displayAll function).  Another display routine (display function) will output one path in detail.
