BinTree - A binary tree made from a list of strings. The code reads a data file consisting of many lines to build binary search trees. Each line consists of many strings and terminates with the string “$$”. Each line will be used to build one tree. The duplicated strings (i.e., having equal values with existing node data) are discarded, smaller strings go left, and bigger go right.
